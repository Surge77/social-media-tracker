# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature separates the main feed functionality from the landing page by creating a dedicated feed route. The landing page will remain focused on marketing and onboarding, while the feed functionality moves to a new `/dashboard/trending` route. This improves first impressions, enables better conversion flows, and allows for separate optimization strategies.

## Glossary

- **Landing Page**: The root route (/) that serves as the marketing and onboarding experience
- **Feed Route**: The new dedicated route (/dashboard/trending) that contains the main feed functionality
- **Feed Container**: The main component that orchestrates data fetching and filter management
- **CTA**: Call-to-Action buttons that guide users from landing to feed
- **Client-side Navigation**: Route changes that occur without full page reloads using Next.js router
- **Route Splitting**: Code organization where heavy components are loaded only when their route is visited
- **Dashboard Layout**: Persistent layout component with header and sidebar for app pages
